# Toy 2x2 Geant4 Simulation - Pixel focused 

This repository contains a **Geant4-based simulation** designed to study how the **2x2 detector** (a prototype of the DUNE Near Detector) can be sensitive to **new physics**, including but not limited to **millicharged particles**, **long-lived particles**, and other exotic signatures.

The simulation framework is structured to allow future integration of:
- **Event generation from [Pythia8](https://pythia.org/)** (currently planned)
- **Output to a ROOT TTree** for detailed offline analysis (currently planned)

## 🚧 Current Features

- Toy detector geometry implementation using `G4PVParameterised` to replicate pixel CRO structure.

## 📁 Project Structure

The simulation uses a standard Geant4 application layout with the following key components:

| Component               | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `DetectorConstruction` | Defines the 3D geometry and materials of the 2x2 detector. Uses parameterized volumes to fill the active region. |
| `PrimaryGeneratorAction` | Will later inject particles generated by Pythia8. Currently serves as a placeholder for basic test beams. |
| `SteppingAction`       | Handles step-by-step tracking. Will later be used to extract energy depositions, track hits, and push to output trees. |
| `EventAction`          | Manages per-event data collection and (in the future) ROOT tree filling. |
| `RunAction`            | Controls logic before and after the simulation run. Useful for initializing analysis structures. |
| `ActionInitialization`| Connects the above components to the Geant4 kernel. |
