class G4SteppingAction : public G4UserSteppingAction
declares a new class called G4SteppingAction, which inherits from the Geant4 base class G4UserSteppingAction.



G4SteppingAction::G4SteppingAction(...)
The part before the :: — G4SteppingAction — is the class name.
The part after the :: — also G4SteppingAction — is the constructor function, which has the same name as the class.
This constructor is called automatically when an object of the class is created, to initialize its member variables and set up internal behavior.


G4EventAction* eventAction;
G4RunAction* runAction;
G4PrimaryGeneratorAction* primaryGenAction;
the * means that these are pointers to objects, not the objects themselves.
G4EventAction* eventAction; → eventAction is a pointer to a G4EventAction object.
| Expression        | Meaning                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `Type* x;`        | `x` is a pointer to `Type`                            |
| `x = new Type();` | Allocate a `Type` object and store its address in `x` |
| `*x`              | Dereference the pointer to access the object          |
| `x->member`       | Access a member of the object pointed to by `x`       |


pointer->member
is exactly the same as:
(*pointer).member
